run_analysis.R should do the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.





directory /project_data, contains all files needed for evaluation by run_analysis.R

README.md, this file.

codebook.md, contains the description of variables produced by run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R, is the R script that produces the tidyData.txt file

tidyData.txt, is the file generated by run_analysis.R, which contains the reshaped data set processed from /project_data





1) create a directory on your local machine where you would like to clone the repository

2) change directory into what you created in #1

3) clone this repository : git clone https://github.com/dholtz/GettingAndCleaningData

4) change directory into the GettingAndCleaningData directory

5) start R from the command line

6) source("run_analysis.R")
